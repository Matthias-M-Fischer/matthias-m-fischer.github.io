	<postsynopsis>
	You are reading the very first post on my personal blog. While I have been contemplating starting my own blog for quite some months now, it took something I have read just recently on Dynamic Ecology to actually make me follow through with that plan.
	</postsynopsis>

	<post>
	In <a href="https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2020/01/29/2020-reader-survey-results/">this post</a>, Jeremy Fox talks about how the rise of Twitter may be related to the decline in numbers of people reading personal blogs. Specifically, he writes:<p>

		<quote>[S]ocial media has replaced many of the functions that blogging used to serve. And Twitter is designed to be engaging, attention-grabbing; reading blogs isn’t designed that way. It was always a question of when, not if, this blog would cease to defy the general trend and start losing readers to Twitter.</quote><p>

	This is something I could easily relate to, as I do use Twitter myself – although only privately and for non-professional contacts. And I do have to agree: Twitter by design really excels at continuously and repeatedly grabbing one‘s attention – especially if one tends to be distractible in general and carries around a smart phone on a daily basis. It is, of course, easy to partake in the growing crowd of people criticising Twitter (or social media in general, for that matter) for exactly this reason, but I think this would miss the point. In my opinion, Twitter does have a place in the set of means of communication which we can use to our advantages. However, like any medium, it has its own specific set of use cases – as well as use cases it does not excel at at all.</p>

	This is where blogs come into the picture. As soon as we want to talk about things which cannot be stated in one or a short series of messages consisting of 280 characters each, competing for the limited amount of user attention in a nearly infinite stream of witty one-liners, cute animal pictures, breaking news and memes, all neatly sorted by the amount of likes, comments and retweets received, we need something entirely else. Or, put more bluntly: all that <em>boring</em> stuff that requires a bit more attention and focus does not belong there.</p>

	So what kind of <em>boring</em> stuff exactly can you expect here in general? To be perfectly honest, I have not completely worked that out yet, but I do have at least a rough idea. As a (very, very early-stage, admittedly) scientist, who is an avid reader and big fan of blogs such as the already mentioned <a href=https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/>Dynamic Ecology</a> or the equally wonderful <a href=https://scientistseessquirrel.wordpress.com/>Scientist Sees Squirrel</a>, I will primarily concern myself with similar topics. However, there naturally are quite a lot of things on which I do consider myself far from being an expert. Accordingly, I will not talk about these, and instead focus on those things about which I think I am able to say something meaningful – or at least interesting ;). This will include summaries of and comments on my own papers, projects I am currently working on, random ideas and plans that come to my mind, summaries of stuff I have learned and which I think might be useful for other people, thoughts about interesting papers and preprints, and similar things. (Side note: I will also have to come up with some intelligent way of indexing posts in order to allow for finding and revisiting things easily based on some broad categories.)</p>

	I am very well aware that these are very niche topics, which probably will not be able to gain all that much attention. Especially given the ongoing shift of attention towards other forms of communication experienced by older and more established blogs, the chances seem to look even bleaker. One might even very well argue, that the era of personal blogs is already coming to its end and starting an entirely new one at this point of time may be ill-advised. However, the question remains: Why not? Even if this project never gets any real continuous attention – which I think is perfectly within what is possible – it will nonetheless serve as a neat archive of things I have been working on over time, which in future might very well be useful for me, as well as the random user stumbling upon this site following some specific Google search.</p>

	Some things I intend to talk about in the next posts include, in no particular order

	<ul>
		<li>The preparation of aesthetically pleasing, sleek and modern looking diagrams (with a particular focus on the Python libraries matplotlib and seaborn, as these are my go-to tools for data visualisation). My current PhD work is heavily concerned with the analysis of multivariate experimental datasets, so data visualisation is something I have been doing a lot recently and grow quite adept at.</li>

		<li>My first paper I have written as the first (and also the only) author, which got published just recently in Environmental and Ecological Statistics. Specifically, I intend to talk a little bit about the backstory of the project, its broader context, as well as some (very positive) experiences during peer review and my conclusions drawn from them, which might turn out to be helpful for other early-stage folks like me.</li>

		<li>Some general principles I use for organising multiple parallel projects, which are e.g. applicable, but not limited to managing multiple manuscripts at the same time with the ultimate goal of publication. This will build on the idea of the „publishing pipeline“, on general principles of project management and on the notion that shipping a product is one of its most important features, as argued by Joel Spolsky on his <a href=https://www.joelonsoftware.com/>blog</a> (another one I am an avid reader of). Interestingly, I have repeatedly met quite a lot of people who are absolutely brillant at their research and at coming up with fascinating ideas and plans, but for one reason or another do not manage to take the final step and complete the things they started. As someone who, in contrast, does not come up with new research ideas all that easily at all, but is pretty good at following through with projects, this puzzles me and makes me speculate about possible reasons for that.</li>

		<li>My conclusions from three years of TA-ing biostatistics and two years of bioinformatics for young biology undergraduates at Freie Universität Berlin, where I pursued my Bachelor‘s and Master‘s studies myself. I suspect that some of these things might be interesting and helpful to others who have just started out teaching at university and try to make it the best possible experience for their students. I will probably write a lot of rather basic things on that topics, which in my opinion nonetheless cannot be stressed often enough.</li>
